      <p> I'm Hemant Gupta, <strong> UX Design Intern at Samsung Design Delhi</strong> and currently pursuing  Master's programme in Interaction Design at <strong>National Institute of Design</strong> (India).</p>
<p>I love to travel, explore new places and being a defence kid (Indian Air Force) I had the opportunity to travel across the country during my school days which has inclucated an intrinsic behavior of human interaction. </p>
  <p>I see myself as a perpetual learner and have a knack of learning new things quickly. Front-end development of this website is one amongst the examples of showcasing that skill. </p>

              Iâ€™ve known Hemant for 5 months. We worked together on Tata Wearables Makerthon to compete with 7 finalists. our job was to converge the health measures in a wearable yet keep it optimised to keep user notified and safe. His ideas were game changers in our presentation. But in order to ensure that the project is in control and heading in right direction to achieve the targets of brief , he took the extra steps of staying late and coming early before classes. He has a good sense of 3D modeling and user centered design. As a loyal team member, he motivated all of us to bring out the best. Many thanks for his contribution!</p><br>
