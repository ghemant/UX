            <p> As of June 2018, the services provided by Samsung India to their customers have been very mobile
              application
              specific in its approach.
              There are many previously existing and newly introduced native Samsung apps and services, which have been
              catering to the one or the other
              aspect of a daily life of its users. <br> For example Samsung Health for monitoring health, Samsung Pay
              for
              making digital payments, Samsung Members for community building, Galaxy apps as a app store for Samsung
              devices, and many more.
              <br><br>
              The immediate requirement was to first find answers to the following questions to better identify the need
              to solve for in this project:

            <br><br>
            <ul>

              <li>‚ñ†&emsp;Why designing a rewards platform for Samsung is important?</li>
              <li>‚ñ†&emsp;Who are the competitors and how are they making use of rewards system?</li>
              <li>‚ñ†&emsp;How can all these apps and services be unified?</li>

              Therefore, to better understand target group, the desk research method was undertaken. For which a lot any
              white papers, survey reports
