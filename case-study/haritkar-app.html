      <h4>About the project</h4>
      <p>The project was done as part of an Instructional Graphic Design course
        at NID. The brief of the project was to design a mobile application for
        the Swachh Bharat Mission.</p> <p> Haritkar (i.e. Harit + Kar; where "Harit" means
        "Green" and "kar" relates for "Workforce" in Hindi) is an unique application
        that simply allows municipality to be efficient in performing their duties. </p>
        <p>The municipality workers is an user group that is quite unique and challenging
          to design for. Although the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a fad in India,
          but the heavy duty of keeping the city clean is still done by municipality workers,
          who are the majorly ignored task force of the society. </p>

      <p><strong>Understanding the user</strong></p>

      <p> I conducted a small primary research study (observation method) that helped me understand why municipality was not efficient? and especially the problems faced by municipality cleaning workers.
        My observations suggested following facets of municipality workers:  </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Majority of the workers are hard working,</li>
          <li>they need to reach at various locations quickly,</li>
          <li>they are friendly and diligent in duties, but are always ill treated by the senior officials and</li>
          <li>they are the <strong>ignored task force</strong> of the society</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Hence, my proposal for the app is a scenario where the app helps the workers to <strong>reach</strong> desired <strong>locations quickly</strong>, allows their work
         <strong>status updated</strong> to the higher authorities <strong>transparently</strong> and thus getting <strong>recognised for their work</strong>  on larger platform.
