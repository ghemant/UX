      <h2 class="title is-3"> About the Project</h2><br>
      Propsed concept of a rewards platform which enables users to discover 
      newer Samsung services and redeem their existing points from a single point access.
      <br><br>
      The project was aimed at exploring the existing Samsung Apps / Services being offered in India and
       how they can be unified together for a rewarding user experience for the Samsung customers across
        the various channels online and offline. Therefore, rewards system or otherwise known as customer 
        loyalty programs system were taken into consideration, to allow Samsung to grow their business 
        that would requires fewer resources and time; that will help retain and increase their customers 
        by turning them into vocal advocates.

      <h2 class="title is-3">My Roles and responsibilities</h2>
      <!-- <img class="design-process" src=""> -->
      <li>As part of the UX team at Samsung Design Delhi(SDD), I was responsible for the UX and user research aspects of an explorative project i.e. Unified Rewards Platform for Samsung apps and services. 
        I proactively collaborated across the product, design and business teams right from the onset of the project. </li> 
      <br><li>Conducted various brainstorming discussions, taking key design decisions while creating the low-to-high fidelity mockups, presenting it in internal demos to various stakeholders.</li>
      <br><li>Planned and conducted secondary and primary research, compared various similar products to understand their frameworks etc.</li>
      <br><li>Apart from work contributions, I also helped the team in other collaborative efforts like taking in-house design workshops and user research.</li>

      <h2 class="title is-3">The Approach</h2>
      <!-- <img class="design-process" src=""> -->
      As of June 2018, the services provided by Samsung India to their customers have been very mobile application specific in its approach.
There are many previously existing and newly introduced native Samsung apps and services, which have been catering to the one or the other 
aspect of a daily life of its users. <br> For example Samsung Health for monitoring health, Samsung Pay for making digital payments, Samsung Members for community building, Galaxy apps as a app store for Samsung devices, and many more.
<br><br>
The immediate requirement was to first find answers to the following questions to better identify the need to solve for in this project:
<br><br>
<ol>
  <li>What are the native apps / services and the ecosystem, that Samsung provides to its users?</li>
  <li>Why designing a rewards platform for Samsung is important?</li>
  <li>Who are the competitors and how are they making use of rewards system?</li>
  <li>How can all these apps and services be unified?</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Understanding the target users:</h2>
      The business and design team had taken a decision and identified target user group as to be Millennial and younger generations.
        Therefore, to better understand target group, the desk research method was undertaken. For which a lot any white papers, survey reports 
        and articles were referenced to know more about the millennial‚Äô behavior over the past years.
