            <p>Proposed the enhnacements to the user experience of 3rd party cab-aggregator drivers</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The project is the outcome of 4th semester design project for a duration of 10 weeks during February -
              April 2018, at the National Institute of Design - Bengaluru, India.
              The objective of the design project was to understand and apply the systems/service design process and
              methods for conceptualization, while keeping the focus on <strong>System/ Service design</strong>
              paradigm.

              <hr><br> Problem statement
            </h2>
           
            
            <p> The project was aimed at exploring the existing modes of transportation within the urban cities, and understand the existing problems faced by commuters
               in their daily commute. Intially, it started off with the travellers as primary target audience in mind, but with time and further research it was discovered
               that not only travellers have better solutions to avail transportation but also helped in identifying the friction that existed between the riders and drivers.
               <br>
               On further investigation, it was found that the for riders there were so many ways of making their experience more easy, however the other side of the equation
               i.e. drivers were totally ignored by the transportation system.
               
               <br>
               The focus of this project was on the cab travel experience because most of the users (i.e. riders) interviewed initially, were mostly using cabs for their commuting needs.
               And they complained about the driver behaviours. To understand why does that happen, drivers were interviewed and they had a completely
               different story to narrate. 
               <br> <br> Therefore, resulting into the complete direction change in the research focussing on drivers as primary persona for further studies and coming up with below design brief i.e.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                To make the experience more simpler, profitable and safer for aggregator cab drivers.
              </blockquote>

            For this project I intended to do something with the<strong class="highlightIt"> transportation system in
              the city </strong> (like Bangalore). So, I started off by conducting a participatory brainstorming session
            with a group of people who had
            different experiences in travelling within a city (going to college / office / resturants / pubs etc.); and
            asked them to write down with anything that comes to their mind related to transportation within a city like
            Bangalore (without discussing
            anything with other participants). <br><br>

            <h2 class="title is-5">üè∑Ô∏è Participatory brainstorming session </h2>
            <img class="design-process"
              src="../images/case-studies/cab-driver-experiences/processDocumentation/participatoryBrainstorming.png">
            
            


            After the brainstorming session, all the points that the participants had jotted down were discussed amongst
            the participating group, and <strong class="highlightIt">affinity mapping</strong> of the ideas was done to
            explore the different domains
            that emerged from the exercise.</p>

            As an output of the above exercise, few<strong class="highlightIt"> problem domains</strong> emerged (listed
            below) which were wide enough for the participants to frame HOW MIGHT WE question on those topics.

            <ul>

              <li>‚ñ†&emsp;Information accessibility</li>
              <li>‚ñ†&emsp;Language Barrier</li>
              <li>‚ñ†&emsp;<strong>Safety</strong></li>
              <li>‚ñ†&emsp;<strong>Causes of Frustrations (Commuters / Drivers)</strong></li>
              <li>‚ñ†&emsp;Infrastructure</li>
              <li>‚ñ†&emsp;Expensive (Travelling cost)</li>

            </ul>



            <p>Later on, I invited different group of participants to rate the <strong class="highlightIt">How Might
              We</strong> questions, so that the voting would remain unbaised and brings new perspective to the already
            identified problem areas.</p>
            <br>

            </blockquote>

            For this I started off my primary research by <strong class="highlightIt">observing the interactions between
              transpotation service providers</strong> (drivers / conductors / air hostesses etc.) and <strong

            Being in constant discussions with my faculty, friends, and fellow designers; I realised there were many
            solution already existing for the commuters <strong class="highlightIt">but there were hardly any solutions
              which took care of the drivers / conductors' experience</strong> while they perform their duty.
            So I decided to work on a smaller system of aggregated cab services in India, to understand how drivers are
            affected and how their user experience can be improved?</p>

                <li>‚ñ†&emsp;They easily got used to the concept of how to access the new features.</li>
                <li>‚ñ†&emsp;However, they were sceptical about possibility of these features because they feel they are on their own and OLA would not go through all of these pains to help them out.</li>

              <p>
                The mobile application features list for OLA is just the <strong>1st part of the BIG solution</strong> as an outcome of this project. Apart from the mobile application enhancement, I am in the process of making a <strong>business model proposal for cab
               aggregator services like OLA / Uber</strong> keeping in mind the cab driver's Experiences, which <strong>NOT ONLY</strong> provides them new avenues to generate revenues for their business model <strong>BUT ALSO</strong> allows them to retain a
                loyal drivers fleet for the long run. <br><br>
              <i>The development of the business model is currently a W.I.P (work in progress), please check back for the business model section (to be added soon).</i>

              <hr>Key Highlight + Little Bragging üòâ</h2>
            This complete project was <strong>independently</strong> conceived and presented as a Design Project outcome
            of <strong>10 Weeks</strong> duration (<strong>February - April 2018</strong>) in
            <strong>M.Des Interaction Design</strong> 4th Semester at National Institute of Design, India. <br><br>

            Some of my design research observations and insights proposed feature enhancements for Cab Aggregator
            services (i.e. taking OLA as a case study), for example <br> <br>
            üëâ easy accessibility of necessary trip information (including live traffic data) <br><br>
            üëâ enhancing the heat map interaction <br> <br>
            were similar to what Uber has introduced in their <a href="https://www.uber.design/case-studies/driver-app">
              "The New Driver App: Building a better co-pilot"</a> launched in <strong> April 2018</strong> . However, the 
            research findings had few more features which were not implemented by any of the cab aggregator app as of then. <br> <br>
