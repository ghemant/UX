      <h4>About The Project</h4>

      <p class="firstParaMargin"><br>The project is the outcome of 4th semester design project for a duration of 10 weeks during February - April 2018, at the National Institute of Design - Bengaluru, India. </p>
      <p class="firstParaMargin">The <strong>objective</strong> of the design project was to understand and apply the systems/service design process and methods for conceptualization, while keeping the focus on System/ Service design paradigm to conceptualizing physical devices
        for home,
        <strong> automobile </strong>, healthcare, banking and retail. </p>

      <h4>User Research</h4>
      <p class="firstParaMargin">
        For this project I intended to do something with the<strong class="highlightIt"> transportation system in the city </strong> (like Bangalore). So, I started off by conducting a participatory brainstorming session with a group of people who had
        different experiences in travelling within a city (going to college / office / resturants / pubs etc.); and asked them to write down with anything that comes to their mind related to transportation within a city like Bangalore (without discussing
        anything with other participants).
      </p>

      <img class="design-process" src="../images/case-studies/cab-driver-experiences/processDocumentation/participatoryBrainstorming.png">
      <p class="image-notes">Participatory brainstorming session.</p>

      <p class="firstParaMargin">
        After the brainstorming session, all the points that the participants had jotted down were discussed amongst the participating group, and <strong class="highlightIt">affinity mapping</strong> of the ideas was done to explore the different domains
        that emerged from the exercise.</p>

      <p>As an output of the above exercise, few<strong class="highlightIt"> problem domains</strong> emerged (listed below) which were wide enough for the participants to frame HOW MIGHT WE question on those topics.
        <ul>
          <li>Information accessibility</li>
          <li>Language Barrier</li>
          <strong class="highlightIt"><li>Safety</li>
          <li>Causes of Frustrations (Commuters / Drivers)</li></strong>
          <li>Infrastructure</li>
          <li>Expensive (Travelling cost)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="firstParaMargin">
        Later on, I invited different group of participants to rate the <strong class="highlightIt">How Might We</strong> questions, so that the voting would remain unbaised and brings new perspective to the already identified problem areas.

        How Might We <strong class="highlightIt">encourage the urban commuting</strong> TO <strong class="highlightIt">enhance the experience of people</strong> with the help of technology?
      </blockquote>

      <p>For this I started off my primary research by <strong class="highlightIt">observing the interactions between transpotation service providers</strong> (drivers / conductors / air hostesses etc.) and <strong class="highlightIt"> passengers</strong>.

      <p class="firstParaMargin">
        Being in constant discussions with my faculty, friends, and fellow designers; I realised there were many solution already existing for the commuters <strong class="highlightIt">but there were hardly any solutions which took care of the drivers / conductors' experience</strong>        while they perform their duty.</p>
      <p class="highlightIt">So I decided to work on a smaller system of aggregated cab services in India, to understand how drivers are affected and how their user experience can be improved?

        <li>Many cab drivers have been falsely alleged for harassment of female passengers</li>

      <p class="firstParaMargin">Observations from the UT</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mental model of the mobile app is existing with the OLA Partners.</li>
        <li>They easily got used to the concept of how to access the new features.</li>
        <li>However, they were sceptical about possibility of these features because they feel they are on their own and OLA would not go through all of these pains to help them out.</li>

      <h4>Future Scope</h4>
      <p class="firstParaMargin">
        The mobile application features list for OLA is just the <strong>1st part of the BIG solution</strong> as an outcome of this project. Apart from the mobile application enhancement, I am in the process of making a <strong>business model proposal for cab
       aggregator services like OLA / Uber</strong> keeping in mind the cab driver's Experiences, which <strong>NOT ONLY</strong> provides them new avenues to generate revenues for their business model <strong>BUT ALSO</strong> allows them to retain a
        loyal drivers fleet for the long run.</p>
      <p>The development of the business model is currently a W.I.P (work in progress), please check back for the business model section (to be added soon).</p>

    <div class="section key-takeaways">
      <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Realised the how important it is to bounce off your ideas to different people and get their perspective.</li>
        <li>Made use of the methods that I learnt during the Bangalore Service JAM 2018, e.g. participatory brainstorming and HMW techniques.</li>
        <li>Build a basic understanding of how to study a service / system, using various perspectives. Learnt how to use PESTEL and WWWWH frameworks.</li>
        <li>Was able to conduct an actual user testing with real users (i.e. Cab Drivers) though very few in numbers; realised how easy it would be to test something which they are really used to (in this case existing OLA driver mobile app).</li>
