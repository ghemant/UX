      <h2 class="title is-3">About The Project</h2>
      <p class="firstParaMargin">The project is the outcome of a classroom project in Ubiquitous Computing
        module, in July 2017, of a duration of 3 weeks, at the National Institute
        of Design - Bengaluru, India.</p>
      <p>As a part of the curriculum, the students were required to read a lot of
         research papers as reading material to build an understanding of what Ubiquitous means? <br>
        We observed that most of the classmates spoke about the struggle and frustrations; at maintaining
        focus and being constantly zoned out while comprehending the information in those materials.</p>
      <blockquote cite="http://">
          Bro! I can not read through the papers, I am getting zoned out every now and then while reading them.
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        <h2 class="title is-3">The Problem</h2>

         <span class="subtitle is-4 has-background-light">  Not being able to maintain <em> FOCUS</em> and comprehend the information available in printed reading materials by the students / researchers.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
        <h2 class="title is-3">Final Deliverable</h2>
        <p> A design research paper on this project documenting the process and the findings, has been accepted by SIDeR'18 (Student Interaction Design Research) conference. You can view the paper by clicking the button below.

      <img class="design-process" src="../images/case-studies/focus-pen/team.jpg">
      <p class="image-notes">From left to right: Andre Parr, Hemant Gupta and Akshay Khurana.</p>

      <p>We were <strong>a team of 3 students </strong> from Interaction Design : Akshay, Andre and I - who had different strengths in 3D modelling, graphic design and user research respectively.
        <br>In this project <i> my <strong>roles</strong> and <strong>responsibilities</strong></i> were</p>
        <ul>
          <li>observing user behaviour which resulted into identifying the <strong>lack of focus as a pain point</strong>;</li>
          <li>taking care of the user research which covered conducting user interviews</li>
          <li>planning and executing the user experiments</li>
          <li>helped in building the physical prototype (explored different materials: Bamboo, MDF, Acryllic etc)</li>
          <li>contributed in storyboarding and shooting of the use-case scenario video</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Working with this team helped all of us to learn from each other's strengths.

    <div class="section ourApproach">
      <h2 class="title is-3">Understanding</h2>
      <p class="firstParaMargin">We started off with initial discussions amongst ourselves to build an understanding of</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is Ubiquitous Computing (or Ubicomp)? and</li>
          <li>What could be the desired product to qualify as a ubicomp product?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We found ubicomp is an IoT concept which enables computing by taking inputs
          from anywhere, at anytime, using any device and outputs data in any format necessary.</p>
          <p>While looking for answers to what could be an ideal device to solve the problem at hand,
             we realised that a pen / pencil is the most versatile and widely used object in the context i.e while studying.
            Users generally used pen / pencil for taking notes, making annotations, traversing between lines while reading, or just to fidget.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>Therefore, we thought of rethinking the idea of note taking and research by reimagining the pen as a connected device.</strong> </p>
      <img class="design-process" src="../images/case-studies/focus-pen/whiteboard.jpg">
      <p class="image-notes">Whiteboard discussions.</p>


      <h2 class="title is-3">Our Approach</h2>
      <p class="firstParaMargin">Since, this particular module was  for a small duration of 3 weeks only therefore we
        decided to make use of following steps : </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design and conduct an user experiment (in a controlled environment )</li>
          <li>Identifying pain / gain points of using pen or pencils from above experiment study</li>
          <li>Quick prototyping</li>
          <li>Feedback and Iterate</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Research</strong>
        <p class="firstParaMargin">The user experiement was designed in such a way that it comprised of 2-3 primary research methods: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal Interviews</li>
          <li>Contextual Inquiry (in a controlled environment)</li>
          <li>Observations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In which we invited various students from different departments of our college as participants.</p>
        <img class="design-process" src="../images/case-studies/focus-pen/userExperiment.png">
        <p class="image-notes">User experiment designed & conducted by Hemant; sessions recorded by Akshay & Andre.</p>

        <strong>Observations / Insights</strong>
        <p class="firstParaMargin">Based on the experiment study conducted in a controlled environment, following observations were made: (important ones are emphasised) </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Some users don’t want to defile the document</em></strong></li>
          <li>Puts pen back in its dedicated space</li>
          <li><strong><em> Fidgeting speed relative to concentration</em></strong>
            <img class="design-process" src="../images/case-studies/focus-pen/mayaFidgeting.gif">
          </li>
          <li><strong><em>Google search on mobile used to look up words</em></strong></li>
          <li><strong><em>Some use a notebook/some write in the margins for note-taking</em></strong></li>
          <li><strong><em>Mobile phone is a major distraction</em></strong></li>
          <li>Preference of pencil is observed among most users</li>
          <li>Use the pen to traverse the reading</li>
          <li>One user used sticky notes</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong>Quick Prototyping</strong>
        <p class="firstParaMargin">To get a better understanding of form factor of a pen / penci, we dicided to design / sketch different
         pen forms which could take care of the insights discovered from our primary
           research. We made <strong><em> 9 </em></strong>pen prototypes using bamboo, and went back to our users (in this case, students)
            to see their reactions and use behavior with new forms. </p>
            <img class="design-process" src="../images/case-studies/focus-pen/workshopPrototyping.png">

        <img class="design-process" src="../images/case-studies/focus-pen/formSketches.jpg">
        <p class="image-notes">Sketches by Andre; prototypes made by Akshay, Andre and Hemant.</p>
        <strong>Feedbacks and Iterate</strong>
        <p class="firstParaMargin">After few discussions with our primary users (students / researchers), we presented our concept to faculties
        and seeked their feedback. All these excercises helped us iterate and decide upon the final form of the pen
        and also made us realise the need for a companion dock. </p>
        <img class="design-process" src="../images/case-studies/focus-pen/formPresentation.png">
        <p class="image-notes"></p>
        <p>We then proceeded with mind-mapping of the various components and features that the proposed
          product should have.</p>

      <strong>Information Architechture & UI Design</strong>
      <p class="firstParaMargin">We also designed the companion mobile and web application,
        but because of the want of time made a few screens to communicate the idea of how it would look.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Key Takeaways</h2>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Learnt a great deal while planning and executing an user experiment (that too in a controlled environment);
          <ul>
            <li>Asking for participants' timeslot well in advance</li>
            <li>Making sure the experiements are timebound, and effective</li>
            <li>Camera angles while recording these kind of sessions</li>
            <li>improvising on the spot to get instantaneous user reactions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Having team members having different strengths, I feel my visual aesthetic sense has improved a great deal.</li>
        <li>I realised what is the importance of thorough secondary research; we could not find any product similar to ours in terms of features and use cases. However, later I came
           across <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/2678-noteon-smartpen" target="_blank">"NoteOn Smartpen"</a> project by Nick Ames, who had already made a prototype of a smart pen. </li>
        <li>Building bamboo pen forms and companion dock(with MDF & Acryllic) was a great experience of material understanding.</li>
        <li>Learned from our mistakes and success while making the video prototype from storyboarding, screen framing, lighting and camera shots.</li>
      </ul>
